- How might this help?
  - I suppose because we don't rely so much on particular clusters being perfect
  - Also because cells may not belong to discrete clusters, so we can average over what stage exactly they're in
- When they say that they don't allocate cells to distinct clusters, what they mean is that one cell can belong to more than one cluster, but they still ultimately test those clusters for frequencies
  - Interpretation is presumably still done on the basis of the neighbourhoods

- A nearest-neighbour graph is simply where you join each point (or observation or element) to the one that is closest to it
- A k-NN graph is one where you join each observation to the `k` observations closest to it

# What is a neighbourhood?

<span style="align: left"> A neighbourhood is all cells that are connected to an index cell <span>

These cells are therefore either nearest neighbours to the index cell, or the index cell is a nearest neighbour to them

Statistical testing centres on the neighbourhood

- Hard to say


- In the supp, they say that if you suspect differential abundance in disconnected, rare subsets, you should (perhaps greatly, I think) increase the proportion of cells sampled initially

- First, for each neighourhood for each sample, the number of samples are counted
- These are modelled using a negative binomial model
  - Allows for more complex experimental designs
  - Allows for skewer distributions
  - Allows cell count to vary by sample
- We get out p-values, which we correct using a so-called spatial FDR

  <img src="img/spatial_fdr.png"
      width="900px" />
</div>

???

- Key point here is that they used an FDR that was "more lenient" because cells could belong to more than one neighbourhood, and so be tested twice
- Very similar formula to the regular FDR procedure, except that per-neighbourhood q-values include weights for how "tight" a neighbourhood is
  - Tighter neighbourhoods are more independent and so are penalised more heavily

- Not exactly clear how you'd interpret that
  - Perhaps look at "most" different neighbourhood?
- They say that this region was not even identified as a distinct cluster by other methods

???

- `Cydar`
  - Assign cells to overlapping hyperspheres, and control FDR using spatial FDR
  
- `DA-seq`
  - Identifies cells belong to regions with differential expression, and *then* clusters them
    - For DA-seq, cells were counted as significant when "absolute differential abundance measure values were larger than the maximum differential abundance measure obtained with randomly permuted labels"


- `Louvain`
  - Assign cells to distinct clusters using graph-based clustering, and tests using a NB GLM

- `Meld`
  - Creates a density based ona  KNN graph
  - User selects threshold for determining statistical significance

???

- For each scenario, they give each cell a probability to belonging to one of two conditions
  - For the in-silico dataset without a continuous trajectory, one cluster was enriched for condition C1 and the others were given probability 0.5
  - For the in-silico datasets with continuous trajectory, one cluster was selected as enriched with the mean cell given "maximum enrichment" and enrichment decreasing outwards from there towards 0.5
  - Not entirely sure what they did with the real world data

- Here they then calculate the TPR (sensitivity) and FDR
  - Two well-chosen measures, as the true-positives are rarer (so getting high TPR with low FDR is hard)

???

- I don't undersatnd why FDR got worse for Cydar and TPR got worse for Louvain as effect size went up
- These are faily big effect sizes
- Milo is controlling the FDR well below the nominal rate of 0.1
  - Indicates problem with spatial FDR control calibration?
- Cydar was very insensitive, as was DAse
- Unclear why Louvain + NB was so quick to declare differences
- Overall, though, based on their simulation setup, their algorithm did the best

  - Allocated cells randomly to one of two batches

???

- Cydar's sensitivity drops off dramatically
- DE-seq gets lots of false positives
- Louvain and Milo used fixed/random effects for batch, and so were fine
- Milo's performance less affected by batch effects than other methods
