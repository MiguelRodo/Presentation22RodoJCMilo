The goal of Presentation22RodoJCMilo is to presentation the results from Dann (2021) - Differential abundance testing on single-cell data using k-nearest neighbor graphs.

To read the presentation, clone the entire repo (not just `2022_07_22-Milo-xaringan.html`) and then open `2022_07_22-Milo-xaringan.html`.

Images are in `img/`.
